### 👋🏼 Hi there, my name is Sofía Pérez

👩🏻‍💻 I am a team-oriented front-end developer with almost 2 years of experience creating web applications applying MACH architectures (Microservices, API-first, Cloud native, and Headless) built with Next JS, React JS, and TypeScript; styling with Vanilla CSS, Styled Components, SASS, and Tailwind. Also, integrating services such as Contentful and Algolia. <br />
🚀 I am looking for challenging opportunities to contribute to user-centered and well-tested UIs that provide real value to the clients/users. <br />
💟 In my free time, I enjoy learning new things, reading novels, and spending quality time with my beloved ones.
